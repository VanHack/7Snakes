# 7Snakes

The Seven Snake program load a grid from a CSV file and search a pair of distinct 7-Snakes.
To consider a pair of distinct 7-Snakes they cannot share cells and your sum values must be the same.
When snakes are found the program will stop the search and output the snakes cells with your sum values.
If no such pair exists the program output FAIL.

To execute:
Open the project using a IDE like Eclipse and Run the class SevenSnakes.java. 
You have to specify full path to CSV file execute it on Program Arguments.
